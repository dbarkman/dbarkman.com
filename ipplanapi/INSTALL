Quick install:
-------------

NOTE: if upgrading, read the UPGRADE file.

I assume a working installation of IPplan v2.99 or higher

In your web tree (normally /home/httpd/html), 

1) create a directory called ipplanapi
2) untar the api tar-ball into this directory
3) change the directory ownership and permissions of the ipplanapi directory
   chown -R root.nobody ipplan
   chmod -R 750 ipplanapi

   this is operating system dependent - the above line is for a Redhat 6.2
   based system. Have a look at the rest of your web tree for the correct
   settings for your system.

   For Redhat 7.x systems use:

   chown -R root.apache ipplanapi
   chmod -R 750 ipplanapi

   It is important to set the correct permissions to prevent people from
   seeing your passwords.

4) modify the paths in the server.php script to the ipplan directory if 
   they are not the default
5) modify the userid and password info in any of the scripts in the
   "examples" directory which you want to use. You need to modify the
   "serverURL" string.

Hope it works!
