The file ipplan-whoisd.php is a simple whois server written using the 
IPplan API based on XML-RPC and php. The php sockets library needs to be
compiled into php for the server to work.

Setup of the server is simple. Edit the ipplan-whoisd.php file and set 
'define' variables at the top of the file. Note that USER and PASSWD
setting are valid users and passwords already created in IPplan.

If you are having issues, turn on the DEBUG setting. This will output
all returned data from the server. You will then be able to determine 
if the software is correctly installed and the whois server can talk
to the IPplan backend. Most issues will be related to directory paths
or authentication.

You can then point a whois client at the server to get information
from the IPplan database:

whois -h localhost '?'			- outputs help
whois -h localhost 'AS Test'		- displays information about AS test
whois -h localhost '10.0.0.1'		- queries netblock 10.0.0.1
